## fragment-masking.ts

This file typically contains code related to fragment masking in GraphQL. Fragment masking is used to define reusable fragments in your GraphQL queries, allowing you to break down complex queries and combine smaller fragments into larger ones. This helps to avoid repeating fields and structures across multiple queries.

### Purpose: 
It enhances modularity and reuse by allowing you to create smaller, focused fragments and then "mask" (or merge) them as needed.

### Usage: 
The file may define helper functions to apply or "mask" fragments to avoid over-fetching data, improving performance and ensuring type safety.


## gql.ts
This file typically contains helper functions to parse and define GraphQL queries and mutations. In some setups, it is used to load and parse .gql or .graphql files, or it might wrap template literals to define GraphQL operations.

### Purpose: 
 It enables you to write and manage GraphQL queries and mutations in a more organized manner.

### Usage: 
  You might see tagged templates in this file, e.g., gql function which helps define and parse GraphQL operations, and ensure that TypeScript has type information for these operations if the project is using code generation tools.



## graphql.ts
This file typically acts as the main GraphQL client configuration file. It could contain setup code to connect with a GraphQL server, handle authentication, define middleware, or manage custom headers.

###  Purpose: 

It provides a central location to configure and initialize the GraphQL client, enabling seamless communication with the GraphQL API.

### Usage: 
It may export a configured instance of a GraphQL client (e.g., Apollo Client), or define methods to handle different GraphQL operations across the project.


##  index.ts
This file usually serves as an entry point for the GraphQL folder, consolidating exports from other files. It simplifies imports by allowing other files to import GraphQL utilities, types, and configurations from a single location.

###  Purpose: 
To streamline access to the folder's contents by re-exporting key exports (e.g., types, queries, mutations, or client instances).

###  Usage: 
Other parts of the project can import index.ts to access everything needed for GraphQL interactions from one place.


##   types.ts
This file generally contains TypeScript types and interfaces generated from GraphQL schemas. It could be generated automatically by tools like graphql-code-generator, creating type definitions that correspond to the types and fields in the GraphQL API.

###   Purpose: 
Provides TypeScript support for GraphQL operations, ensuring type safety and catching errors during development.

###   Usage: 
These types can be used across the project to maintain type safety when working with data fetched from the GraphQL API.
